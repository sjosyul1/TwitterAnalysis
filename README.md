# Opinion-Mining---Twitter
Review Analysis: Useful in situations where a user needs to know general sentiment about a place they would like to visit in the coming months. However,they are not sure about the latest reviews and want to decide whether this is the best place to visit. Even if users want to know about a trending topic happening around the world ,for example any food, movie etc. instead of reading each tweet and deciding the outcome of the event. Users always prefer to view graphical charts which gives a better insight about the trends in any event. Our application deals with this problem, it provides graphical charts based on the tweets retrieved on a  real-time basis through the official twitter streaming API on the search key provided by the user. Tweets are retrieved and sentimental analysis is performed them. This helps us in providing data buckets for the categories labelled positive, negative and neutral . Tweets with the sentimental analysis results are stored on Google Bigquery which handles data warehousing of huge sets of data with high processing speed. Google data studio,a tool which can translate datasets into interactive reports in a quick ,configurable manner is used for providing graphical views of the data from bigquery.
